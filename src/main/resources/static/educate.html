            <h3>What is spelunking?</h3>
                <p>Spelunking (also known as caving) is the recreational exploration of caves. The difficulty level and danger, not unlike hiking or rock climbing, varies widely.

                    On one end of the spectrum, there are certainly family-friendly caves that can be walked through leisurely, or even on a guided tour, using a paved path. On the other end, there are caves that can require rappelling down tens or even hundreds of feet.

                    The challenges involved with spelunking, that can arise at any level of difficulty, can often include negotiating steep ascents or descents (know as pitches), tight spaces (known as squeezes) and even the possibility of cave diving. It is important to note though that while cave diving CAN be experienced during a spelunking trip, it is typically considered to be a separate activity that is far more dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Where do you Spelunk?</h3>
            <p>Across the Unites States alone, there are thousands of caves that can be explored.

                While there are resources available online that outline guided tours, such as Cavern.com, and closed networks of spelunkers offering insights and experiences such as Caves.org, the best way to find caves to explore, that are suitable for your experience level is to do a Google search for caves in your area, and use guides created by reputable national publications and organizations that have done the research.

                That said, if you are looking for a simple list of caves available for spelunking and/or hiking, Wikipedia has a nice offering that is broken down by state.</p>
