          <h3>What is spelunking?</h3>
          <p>
            Spelunking (also known as caving) is the recreational exploration of
            caves. The difficulty level and danger, not unlike hiking or rock
            climbing, varies widely. On one end of the spectrum, there are
            certainly family-friendly caves that can be walked through
            leisurely, or even on a guided tour, using a paved path. On the
            other end, there are caves that can require rappelling down tens or
            even hundreds of feet. The challenges involved with spelunking, that
            can arise at any level of difficulty, can often include negotiating
            steep ascents or descents (know as pitches), tight spaces (known as
            squeezes) and even the possibility of cave diving. It is important
            to note though that while cave diving CAN be experienced during a
            spelunking trip, it is typically considered to be a separate
            activity that is far more dangerous.

          <h3>Where do you Spelunk?</h3>
          <p>
            Across the Unites States alone, there are thousands of caves that
            can be explored. While there are resources available online that
            outline guided tours, such as Cavern.com, and closed networks of
            spelunkers offering insights and experiences such as Caves.org, the
            best way to find caves to explore, that are suitable for your
            experience level is to do a Google search for caves in your area,
            and use guides created by reputable national publications and
            organizations that have done the research. That said, if you are
            looking for a simple list of caves available for spelunking and/or
            hiking, Wikipedia has a nice offering that is broken down by state.
